You can create new PowerPoint slides or add exported elements to an existing slide with the **PowerPoint Export** automation item:

<img alt="Export to PowerPoint from Excel automatically in AutoToolit for Office" src={useBaseUrl('/img/uiExcel/excel-automation-step-powerpoint-export-01-autotoolit-600.png')} width="600" className="dropShadowImages"/>

First, you need to select an [export section](Excel-export-sections-for-automation) to be exported to PowerPoint.

You can import the export section either as image or as Excel object into the presentation. Usually, it is recommended to use the image export.
This export uses only a small amount of memory, keeps the original formatting in the best way and is compatible with web and mobile platforms.
The image is typically exported as vector image. Therefore, texts and numbers are displayed optimally on all screens.

In the next settings you can define, where a new slide should be inserted or which slide should get replaced in an existing presentation.

Also, you can position the exported item precisely on the target slide. The size and distance properties are defined in points, since this is the native unit used by PowerPoint.
