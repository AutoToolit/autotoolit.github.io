The Excel Automation ribbon provided by [AutoToolit for Office](https://autotoolit.com) offers quick access to the most essential automation elements in Excel templates:
- **Export sections** are areas in the Excel workbook, that can be used for exporting to PowerPoint or for sending by e-mail
- **Parameters** are Excel cells, slicers, pivot table filters or data source parameters that can be changed automatically. They can also be made available in PowerPoint for selection by the user.
- **Presets** are sequences of automation steps which can be performed automatically.

This is the new __Auto__ tab you will see in Excel after AutoToolit for Office is installed:
